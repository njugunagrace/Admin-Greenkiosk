Admin-Greenkiosk Backend Project
Admin-Greenkiosk is a Python Django backend project that serves as the foundation for a green grocer product catalog. This project provides a set of REST APIs that allow users to fetch information about various green grocer products, including their images and descriptions. This README will guide you through setting up and using the Admin-Greenkiosk backend.

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

Python 3
Pip (Python package manager)
Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/admin-greenkiosk.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd Admin-Greenkiosk
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the project dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Structure

manage.py is the Django management script.
Configuration
Before running the server, you may need to configure the database settings and other environment-specific variables in greenkiosk/settings.py. You can set the database, secret key, and other configurations there.

Running the Server
To run the Django development server, use the following command:

python manage.py runserver
This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can access the API endpoints through this URL.


Authentication
The project can be configured to use various authentication mechanisms. By default, it uses Django's built-in authentication system. You can customize authentication by modifying the settings in greenkiosk/settings.py.
